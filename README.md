Smart Lender - Applicant Credibility Prediction for Loan Approval

### Description:
One of the most important factors which affect our country’s economy and financial condition is the credit system governed by the banks. The process of bank credit risk evaluation is recognized at banks across the globe. “As we know credit risk evaluation is very crucial, there are a variety of techniques used for risk level calculation. In addition, credit risk is one of the main functions of the banking community

The prediction of credit defaulters is one of the difficult tasks for any bank. But by forecasting the loan defaulters, the banks definitely may reduce their loss by reducing their non-profit assets, so that recovery of approved loans can take place without any loss and it can play as the contributing parameter of the bank statement. This makes the study of this loan approval prediction important. Machine Learning techniques are very crucial and useful in the prediction of these types of data.
The aim of this project is to  predict the probability of credit default based on credit card owner's characteristics and payment history.By finding the credit defaulters, the bank employees can decide whether to provide loan for the candidates.
